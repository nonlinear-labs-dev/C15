Key tracking of the oscillator pitch. It's the scaling factor between the key position of a received MIDI note (relative to C3=60) and the pitch of the oscillator.
At 100.0 the pitch follows the equally temperated scale. At values slightly larger than 100.0 you get a stretched tuning. At 50.0 you get a quartertone scale and at 0.0 the pitch is constant for all keys.
