Crossfades between the signal of branch B and the multiplication (ring modulation) product of branch A and branch B. At lower values the result is an amplitude modulation of signal B (carrier) by signal A (modulator). At 100 % signal B is fully cancelled and the output is only the product "A x B" containing frequencies that are sums and differences of their original frequencies.
